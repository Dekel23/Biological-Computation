## Run Program Locally

1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dekel23/Biological-Computation
  cd Biological-Computation
```

2. Insure Python is installed

```bash
  python --version
```
If needed install Python using the following link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure you added Python to PATH

3. Run program
